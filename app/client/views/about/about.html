          A hackathon is an event where people engage in rapid and collaborative engineering over a relatively short period of time<br/>

          The goal of a hackathon is to create functioning software or hardware by the end of the event and present it.</br></br>
          If you found this, you are probably already in the #hackathon slack channel. </br>If not please join.</br>
          If you need any help finding/forming the team, or help on the day.. or want to bounce your ideas, ask about our current system, talk architecture.. thats a good place to start</br>

          As this is the companies first hackathon - we are not setting a specific goal or theme. Build whatever you want to build. </br></br>Use whatever technology you want to use.
          <br/>
          Fix something that makes dev lives better.. </br>a quick win for customers.. </br>an amazing new technology that you think could be cool.. </br>a new product feature.

          <div class="ui bulleted list">
            <div class="item">A chance to work with people you normally wouldn't.</div>
            <div class="item">An opportunity to learn something new.</div>
            <div class="item">Space and a time to make headway on problems you are interested in.</div>
            <div class="item">A chance to showcase what others may not know is possible.</div>
          </div>

          We believe its important to share learnings. If you participate in the hackathon, we encourage everyone to present.</br>
          Even if the demo is not functioning, you likely learned a new technology or learned something that didnt work. </br>
          Please present anyway

          </br>
          TBC: We want everyone energized for this hackathon - so we will be organising uber eats vouchers for all participants (will be sent to those who register!)
